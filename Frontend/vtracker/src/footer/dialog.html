    <h3><i>Hey, you're missing someone!</i></h3>
    <p>
        This website only collects data on streamers who self-report as a VTuber using the tag system on Twitch.
        If there is a streamer that you believe should be listed on this website who is absent, feel free to 
        <a href="mailto:contact@catbird.club" class="orange"><b>contact me</b></a> with their information.
        Additionally, if you are a streamer yourself and for whatever reason would like to be removed from the website, let me know.
    </p>

    <h3><i>Can I request a feature/contribute?</i></h3>
    <p>
        Sure. No promises that it will get implemented, though - I work on this as a side project when I have the time for it, so it's not my primary focus.
        <br>
        If you have a feature request, you can <a href="mailto:contact@catbird.club" class="orange"><b>send me an email </b></a>
        with the details.
        If you have a direct contribution to make, check out the <a href="https://github.com/CATBIRDS/vTracker" class="orange"><b>GitHub </b></a>
        repository and submit a pull request.
    </p>

    <h3><i>Is there an API?</i></h3>
    <span>
        There is no API at this time; however, <i>all</i> of the data that is used to generate content 
        on this website is publicly available in their most up-to-date form through the following links:

        - 
        <a href="https://vtrackerbucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vtubers.json"><b>Vtuber Twitch Data</b></a> 
        (Data such as stream status, channel tags, stream title, etc.)
    </span>

    <span>
        - 
        <a href="https://vtrackerbucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/history.json"><b>VTuber History Data</b></a> 
        (Data such as daily/monthly average viewers/stream duration, etc.)

        This website is a personal project; I would request that if you wish to make use of the data it generates, 
        grab it from the above links - please do not scrape this site.

    <h3><i>NOTE:</i></h3>
    <p>
        This website is still in development, and as such is prone to bugs - these can range from minor UI disruptions to entire functionality blackouts
        as the site and backend components are being developed and updated. I hope you enjoy using this website, but please do not <i>rely</i> on it for anything other than
        personal usage.
    </p>
